# **String Manipulation by Building a Cipher** (FreeCodeCamp)

Welcome to the **String Manipulation by Building a Cipher** project from **FreeCodeCamp**! This project demonstrates how to implement the **Vigen√®re Cipher** for encryption and decryption, helping you understand string manipulation and basic encryption techniques.

---

## üìù **Project Overview**

This project allows you to:
- Implement the **Vigen√®re Cipher** to encode and decode messages.
- Work with string manipulation techniques in **Python**.
- Understand the process of encryption and decryption with a key.
- Build a reusable encryption tool.

This project is a part of **FreeCodeCamp's** curriculum and aims to teach you fundamental concepts of string manipulation and encryption.

## üöÄ **Usage**

This project provides a **Vigen√®re Cipher** that encrypts and decrypts messages based on a given key.

---

## üîç **How It Works**

1. **Vigen√®re Cipher**:
   - The `vigenere` function encrypts or decrypts a message by shifting each character based on the corresponding character in the key.
   
2. **Encryption**:
   - Each letter of the message is shifted according to the index of the key character.
   
3. **Decryption**:
   - The decryption process reverses the encryption by using a negative shift (using `direction = -1`).

4. **Non-Alphabetic Characters**:
   - Spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged in both encryption and decryption.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**

- **Python** (for implementing the cipher algorithm)
- **String Manipulation** (looping through characters and modifying them based on ASCII values)
